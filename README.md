# PeerGradedAssignmentLeafletForR
This repository is to hold Mark Barkell's using of Leaflet for R to put at least one flag down on a map and to have a datetime listed.  The assignment minimum is that, but it might be that I choose to make it slightly better looking.

## Things I learned during the assignment

1. Use message=FALSE to suppress messages from R in RMarkdown knitting.
2. The HTML codes for Unicode chess characters have terrible formatting
3. If one makes locations around the world, the leaflet map does not work all that well.  The may be solutions, but not looking for them.
